# Build Persist Service

This skill is intentionally thin. Use it as a loader for [`reference/PRD.md`](./reference/PRD.md) and the per-feature references below, not as a requirements copy.

## Required Reading

1. Read [`reference/PRD.md`](./reference/PRD.md) first. It is short: §1 defines the mission, public surface, and non-goals; every later section is a pointer into the reference files.
2. Read the reference file for every area the task touches (see the routing table). The reference files are authoritative for contracts, resource shapes, IAM, env vars, workflows, and verification; each was derived from the service code, not from the old PRD text.
3. Read [`../apply-engineering-guidelines/SKILL.md`](../apply-engineering-guidelines/SKILL.md) for Golden Path constraints.
4. Read lexicon skills when the task changes graph schema validation, vertex/edge contracts, properties, enums, index declarations, or immutability rules.

## Use With Plugin Agents

- Use `conkeldurr` first for platform product classification, existing-deployment checks, and build-vs-integrate decisions.
- Use `machamp` for the Neptune CSV workflow, async processing, cost gates, throttling, idempotency, and workflow verification.
- Use `regigigas` only when Persist must be packaged, released, subscribed, or deployed through the marketplace ecosystem.
- For Interprose-sourced GraphQL fields, use the vendor adapter contract in [`reference/graphql-read-surface.md`](./reference/graphql-read-surface.md) §6 and the PII gate in [`reference/graphql-pii-access-policy.md`](./reference/graphql-pii-access-policy.md); there is no separate vendor-integration skill in this kit.

## Implementation Rules

- Treat the loaded reference files as the single source of truth for routes, GraphSON contracts, Persist Blob handling, data contracts, resource shapes, IAM scopes, env vars, error tags, workflows, and verification. The PRD's §1 is the source of truth for scope and non-goals only.
- Do not implement from this `SKILL.md` alone.
- For an existing Persist deployment, integrate through the `/persist/*` API contracts in the reference files instead of provisioning a duplicate service.
- Keep every reference generic: never add account identifiers, ARNs, peering or snapshot identifiers, or customer and partner names. Use placeholders such as `<account>`, `<stage>`, `<snapshot-id>`.
- If any old skill or rule file conflicts with a reference file, the reference wins; update stale guidance instead of layering compatibility shims. When a reference file and the service code disagree, the code is right and the reference must be corrected.

## Expected Output

Return the product fit, existing-vs-new deployment verdict, reference files used, files/stacks/contracts to change, companion agents/skills loaded, and the verification path drawn from each loaded reference.
