# Use Oracle

Oracle is the public-data ingestion agent. It does NOT contain its own ingestion code — it
**drives the bundled stage skills** under `skills/` (`onboard-county` and its stage skills)
against **one chosen runtime** at `skills/use-oracle/runtime/`, and reads results from the
query DB. This skill is the operating contract: stack selection, catalog path, readiness gate,
stage map, and publish/coverage rules.

## Always read

1. [`reference/durable-orchestration.md`](./reference/durable-orchestration.md) — core
   principles, adapter vs inventory status, CAPTCHA/login as access states, required status
   report, human-required actions, durable learning loop
2. [`reference/continuous-ingestion.md`](./reference/continuous-ingestion.md) — autonomous
   stage advancement, durable handoffs, worker leases/recovery, runtime provenance,
   end-to-end completion, and immutable republish on snapshot drift
3. [`reference/readiness-and-completeness.md`](./reference/readiness-and-completeness.md) —
   YAML catalog fields, jump-of-ingest rules, parcel/permit/destination gates,
   reconciliation, completeness, publication fail-closed
4. [`reference/failure-modes.md`](./reference/failure-modes.md) — ingest and enrichment
   traps (caps, sessions, BBB page vs advertised totals, AWS-remote browser vs operator
   laptop, secrets inject only at process start, S3 staging ≠ Filebase)
5. [`reference/request-routing.md`](./reference/request-routing.md) — name **who** receives
   a records or API request; catalog `records_request` fields
6. [`reference/source-provenance.md`](./reference/source-provenance.md) — upstream SHAs and
   bundled skill import provenance
7. [`../county-readiness-preflight/SKILL.md`](../county-readiness-preflight/SKILL.md) — the
   deterministic validator. `onboard-county` must run it before seed, pilot, or full ingest.

## Choose the stack first

Identify **exactly one** runtime from `skills/use-oracle/runtime/` **before** loading any
stage procedure. Do not warn-and-continue.

| Marker in the runtime | Stack | Load these procedures |
|---|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml`, Restate services, `docs/` | **local** | Bundled `skills/` stage skills. `bootstrap-oracle-infra` is local Docker + Restate. Status: `monitoring-county-ingestion`. |
| AWS/SQS, CDK, `catalog/published-counties.json` | **aws** | AWS profile/region, SQS seed feeder. Do not run Restate handlers. Status: `monitoring-oracle-ingestion`. |

The bundled runtime targets **local Restate + Postgres** by default. Use AWS procedures only
when the runtime checkout contains oracle-node AWS markers.

If both markers are present, or neither, **STOP** and ask which stack this run uses. Never
run Restate procedures against an AWS runtime, or AWS procedures against the local stack.

The selected ingestion stack does not determine where BBB browser automation runs. Run
BBB public-site browser work on approved **AWS-managed remote compute** with US egress,
never in a browser on the operator's machine. Do not require a VM specifically; use the
approved AWS job/container/compute path supplied by `bbb-harvest`.

## What Oracle drives

Bundled stage skills under `skills/` implement the pipeline: appraisal scrape → lexicon
transform → permit harvest → Sunbiz/BBB enrichment → query DB → public Filebase/IPFS publish
surfaces. Lee County, FL is the first full implementation. Oracle is the named entry point
that runs them; it never re-implements a stage.

## Prerequisites

- Work happens in the bundled runtime at **`skills/use-oracle/runtime/`** with sibling repos
  next to it when transforms or query-db tooling are needed: `Counties-trasform-scripts`, and
  `lexicon` (optional). Query DB schema is bundled in `use-elephant-query-db`.
- **Local stack:** Docker, Node 22+, `restate` CLI, `gh` authenticated. No cloud account
  for ingestion.
- **AWS stack:** `AWS_PROFILE` / `AWS_REGION` for the existing `elephant-oracle-node`
  account. Skills never hardcode accounts. STOP before any live AWS run if access is
  missing — discovery still does not need AWS.
- **BBB public-site harvest:** an approved AWS remote execution path with US egress and
  secrets injected at process start. This applies even when the chosen ingestion stack is
  local.
- **Publication:** verify Filebase credential availability, target bucket, and IPNS
  ownership at intake whenever publication is in scope. Request missing secret injection
  immediately; never wait until the publish stage or copy secret values into the catalog.
- For local portal probing, a **US egress IP**.
- Stage skills are bundled in this plugin under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Do **not**
  install skills from external registries.

## Source catalog

The machine-readable county source catalog is
**`skills/use-oracle/runtime/docs/<county>-sources.yaml`**.
`county-discovery` already writes it. Do **not** invent
`Counties-trasform-scripts/<county>/sources/sources.json`.

Human findings stay in `skills/use-oracle/runtime/docs/<county>-county-findings.md` and are
PR'd to `Counties-trasform-scripts/<county>/docs/` as discovery already requires.

## Stage-skill map

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `onboard-county` | Orchestrator: operator intake, then sequences every stage below for a county |
| `bootstrap-oracle-infra` | Verify/bootstrap the chosen stack (local Restate/Postgres, or AWS) |
| `county-discovery` | Research a county; write `docs/<county>-sources.yaml` |
| `county-readiness-preflight` | **Hard gate.** Run the validator; STOP on BLOCKED |
| `county-seed-data` | Produce and stage the parcel seed CSV — only after readiness PASS |
| `county-appraisal-onboarding` | Browser flow, per-county prepare queue, transform-script wiring |
| `validate-county-transform` | Prove transforms extract 100% of available data across variability |
| `county-permit-adapter` | Build the county permit-portal harvester (Accela template + generic path) |
| `county-ingest-run` | Deploy/start the backpressure-aware seed feeder — only after readiness PASS |
| `monitoring-county-ingestion` | **Local stack:** queue/invocation health, artifact counts, DB counts, ETAs |
| `monitoring-oracle-ingestion` | **AWS stack:** SQS/Lambda health, S3 artifact counts, ETAs |
| `sunbiz-corporate-ingest` | Florida statewide Sunbiz corporate bulk ingest + lexicon transform |
| `bbb-harvest` | BBB contractor category harvest for reputation/quality enrichment |
| `query-db-loading-matching` | Load artifacts into the query DB and cross-match by parcel id / address hash |
| `transform-v2-builder` | Author/repair county transform handler packages for elephant-cli transform v2 |
| `overture-places-ingest` | Overture Maps places taxonomy, boundary, and publication gates |
| `county-open-data-publish` | Consolidated property JSON to Filebase/IPFS with IPNS |
| `county-query-table-publish` | Columnar query-table Parquet export and MCP wiring |
| `deploy-open-data-mcp` | Self-host the Elephant open-data MCP server |
| `durable-workflow-builder` | Author Restate pipeline workflows and handlers |

## Start independent work immediately

After intake, create and start the county work queue automatically. Do not wait for one
track to finish before beginning another, and do not ask for confirmation for reversible
discovery or scaffolding:

1. **Enumerate the full source graph:** assessed/GIS sources, every permit jurisdiction,
   delegated authority, predecessor system, Sunbiz boundary, and BBB category scope. Start
   bulk/list/API discovery and custodian-route research immediately.
2. **Determine adapter work:** fingerprint each portal/vendor, map it to an existing
   reusable adapter, and start missing adapter scaffolds, fixtures, and bounded tests as
   soon as the vendor is known. Do not wait for parcel ingestion to finish.
3. **Prove execution and destinations:** verify the chosen ingestion stack, the AWS remote
   BBB execution path, Neon destination identity, Filebase credential availability,
   publication bucket, and IPNS ownership. If access is missing, request it immediately
   while the other tracks continue.
4. **Open blocker routes:** for CAPTCHA, login, prohibited automation, custodian-only
   access, or unavailable exports, classify the state and prepare the named API or records
   request from `reference/request-routing.md` immediately.

The readiness gate blocks seed, pilots, adapter scale-out, and full ingestion. It does not
block source enumeration, bounded probes, adapter implementation/fixtures, access setup,
records-request preparation, or publication-readiness checks.

Start or reuse the durable coordinator defined in
[`reference/continuous-ingestion.md`](./reference/continuous-ingestion.md). A successful
stage or status message must enqueue the next eligible stage; do not pause for operator
confirmation. Persist all stage transitions and cross-environment handoffs in the run
manifest.

## Mandatory operating sequence

Follow this sequence for **every** county, including the first ingest. The preflight
encodes failure modes learned from prior counties (GIS vs tax-roll, fragmented permit
jurisdictions, county one-stop portals). Do not treat those counties as special cases —
apply the same gates at the jump of any new ingest. Do not stage a full seed, run a pilot,
or begin bulk traversal before the validator passes. Begin enumeration, adapter
determination and implementation, access remediation, and publication readiness during
bounded discovery; never implement against an assumed source.

| Step | Action | Existing skill / artifact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Operator intake + launch the independent startup work queue | `onboard-county` intake |
| 2 | Review prior findings, transforms, adapters, manifests, and checkpoints | `skills/use-oracle/runtime/docs/` plus `Counties-trasform-scripts/<county>/` |
| 3 | Bounded source discovery + full jurisdiction/source enumeration | `county-discovery` |
| 4 | Build the catalog; start required adapter fixtures/scaffolds; prove Neon, AWS BBB execution, and Filebase readiness | `docs/<county>-sources.yaml`, `county-permit-adapter`, `bootstrap-oracle-infra` |
| 5–6 | County Readiness Preflight + exceptions | `county-readiness-preflight` validator; **STOP** before seed, pilots, or scale-out if any gate is `BLOCKED` |
| 7–8 | Complete adapters + pilots | `county-permit-adapter`, `county-appraisal-onboarding`, `validate-county-transform` |
| 9–10 | Checkpointed ingest + load | `county-ingest-run`, `query-db-loading-matching` |
| 11–12 | Privacy derivatives + publish | `county-query-table-publish`, `county-open-data-publish` |
| 13 | Verify through Donphan | MCP smoke after publish (`listPublishedCounties`, `getOracleDatasetInfo`) |
| 14 | Freeze evidence and determine completeness | coverage JSON + catalog; completeness only if all eight evidence gates pass |

**Hard gate (also when the user invokes `onboard-county` directly, not only `/oracle`):**

```bash
python3 skills/use-oracle/scripts/validate-county-readiness.py \
  skills/use-oracle/runtime/docs/<county>-sources.yaml
```

Non-zero exit = STOP. Do not call `county-seed-data`, do not start a pilot, and do not
start a full `county-ingest-run`. A passing report (`overall: PASS`, `seed_allowed: true`)
is required before pilot or full ingestion.

Unreadiness, CAPTCHA, login, and custodian-only access are genuine blockers. When one
source is blocked, continue every independent safe workstream. Name the records
recipient from [`reference/request-routing.md`](./reference/request-routing.md) — never
say “request a bulk export” without an office, portal, and system scope.

The validator's `next_automated_actions` are mandatory continuation work, not suggestions.
Drive them while blocker owners handle `required_blocker_actions`.

## How to run

- **Full county:** invoke `onboard-county`. Answer intake once. Drive discovery and update
  `docs/<county>-sources.yaml` while the independent startup tracks run. **Run the
  validator.** Only after PASS continue seed → adapter pilots → full run. Example:

  > Onboard Lee County, FL with the `onboard-county` skill. Start with a ~25-parcel pilot.

- **Single stage:** invoke a stage skill directly. `county-seed-data` and
  `county-ingest-run` still require a passing readiness report first.

- **Prefer bulk and list sources during discovery.** After a seed CSV exists, that seed
  remains the input of record for refresh and repair.

## Read the query DB

Use **`use-elephant-query-db`**. Never hardcode or print `DATABASE_URL`. Prove the
destination through `bootstrap-oracle-infra` and `query-db-loading-matching` before any
write. Do not open writer connections from this plugin.

## Coverage publish contract

Every county onboarding must publish coverage as a public IPFS/IPNS contract, not as an
AWS URL:

1. At intake, verify the Filebase credential is available to the eventual publish runtime,
   the target bucket is correct, and IPNS ownership is proven. Request missing access now.
2. Load county data through the normal source tracks: appraisal, permits, Sunbiz, BBB.
3. Keep `oracle_dataset_coverage` updated per `(county, source)`.
4. After each load/index refresh window, run the query-table and coverage publish path.
5. Public consumers use IPFS/IPNS only. Donphan reads coverage through MCP
   `getOracleDatasetInfo`. Never point users at AWS S3.
6. Wire MCP from the **canonical published-county catalog**, not from a hardcoded county
   list in this skill:
   - call MCP `listPublishedCounties`; or
   - read `skills/use-oracle/runtime/catalog/published-counties.json`;
   - regenerate `PROPERTY_QUERY_TABLE_MAP` / `DATASET_COVERAGE_MAP` from that catalog
     (`node scripts/print-mcp-env-maps.mjs` in an `oracle-node` checkout).

Availability must be typed from the catalog (`publicationScope.level` and readiness
`unsupported` / `supported_partial` / `supported_full`). Never represent unsupported
access as zero records.

**PII publish is human-approved, then automated.** The `Publish` virtual object dry-runs
until a human POSTs the approve handler (`Publish/<county>/approve`). After approval, the
object's `tick` performs the Filebase/IPFS upload. The agent prepares, validates, and may
`--dry-run`. Do not treat publish as a manual human upload, and do not upload without the
durable approval.

## Milestone scope (this story)

**In:** Oracle agent + skill packaging; discover county sources; refresh appraisal/property,
permits, Sunbiz, BBB into the query DB; validate completeness; publish the query table and
coverage; wire MCP so Donphan can query the county and qualify answers by coverage.

**Out:** NEO rewiring, on-chain indexing beyond the query table, and Elephant.xyz UI
changes.

## Rules

- Choose one stack before loading procedures.
- Drive the skills; never improvise ingestion commands a skill does not define.
- Never hardcode or print AWS account ids, secrets, or `DATABASE_URL`.
- Never skip `validate-county-readiness.py` before seed, pilot, or full ingest.
- Run until the requested scope reaches a terminal state in `continuous-ingestion.md`.
  Automatically advance successful stages, supervise durable workers, consume exact handoff
  manifests, and recover compatible stale work within its retry budget.
- Record repository/runtime/configuration/schema provenance before remote dispatch. Never
  silently run a different branch, dirty tree, stale skill copy, or mismatched checkpoint.
- Report completeness honestly. Never call a jurisdiction complete because a pilot succeeded.
- Never solve, bypass, OCR, or evade CAPTCHA.
- Preserve valid unmatched records.
- Keep enrichment (Sunbiz, BBB, places) separate from core permit completeness.
- Drive `bbb-harvest` as a public-site category harvest unless an approved API token
  exists. Run any required browser on approved AWS-managed remote compute with US egress,
  never on the operator's machine. It is not official API coverage. Do not set
  `expected_count` from an advertised listing total without `listing_page_cap` and
  `cap_acknowledged`.
- Runtime Secrets apply at process start. Start a new AWS job/runner after adding AWS or
  Filebase keys; do not assume a running process received them.
- Mark complete only after capture, load, immutable publish, remote readback, catalog/MCP
  registration, and Donphan smoke tests all pass. If loaded data advances after freeze,
  automatically create a new immutable snapshot; never mutate the published one.
- Every status response must use the required status report in
  [`reference/durable-orchestration.md`](./reference/durable-orchestration.md).
