# Deterministic Lambda Template

For `new_repository`, generate the portal backend from
`reference/portal-api-stack.ts`. For `existing_repository`, preserve the
project's established backend and IaC patterns; use this template only when the
change creates a new Lambda-backed service or explicitly adopts it through a
reviewed migration. Do not put tenant values back into this generic reference.

## Required inputs

Map these `portal-spec.json` values to `PortalApiStackProps`:

- `apiName` and `functionName`
- `allowedOrigins`
- `memorySize` (default `512` MB)
- `timeoutSeconds` (default `30`)
- `provisionedConcurrentExecutions` (default `0`)
- `secretNames`
- non-secret `environment`

Account, region, origins, secret names, and environment values are
organization-supplied. Keep placeholders when the operator explicitly permits
them. Never infer or embed those values.

## Deterministic infrastructure

The generated stack must contain:

1. One Node.js Lambda with active X-Ray tracing and Powertools service,
   metrics, and log-level environment variables.
2. An explicit `/aws/lambda/<functionName>` log group retained for 30 days.
3. An HTTP API with operator-supplied CORS origins and a proxy route.
4. A `live` Lambda alias backed by `currentVersion` only when provisioned
   concurrency is greater than zero. With zero, integrate the unqualified
   function and do not publish an unnecessary version.
5. Named Secrets Manager references with `grantRead` on the execution target.
   Secret values never enter CDK source, CloudFormation parameters, or Lambda
   environment variables.
6. A p95 duration alarm at the API budget of 200 ms and an error alarm.
7. CloudFormation outputs for the API endpoint and function name.

## IAM policy

Use least-privilege grants from CDK resources, such as `secret.grantRead()`.
Wildcard IAM resources or actions are forbidden unless AWS does not support
resource-level scoping for the required action. Any unavoidable wildcard must
be narrowly action-scoped and explained inline beside the policy statement.
Do not attach managed administrator policies.

## Provisioned concurrency

`provisionedConcurrentExecutions: 0` is the safe default and means no alias is
created. A positive value creates alias `live` and points API Gateway at that
alias. The feature environment must use the configured value from the portal
spec; production sizing is not guessed.

## Secrets

`secretNames` contains approved secret names or operator-approved placeholder
names, never secret values. The handler retrieves values from Secrets Manager
at runtime. Its execution role receives read access only to the listed secrets.

## Verification

Synthesize the generated stack and inspect the template before deployment:

```bash
pnpm --filter api-cdk cdk synth
pnpm --filter api-cdk cdk diff
```

Reject the generated stack if defaults became hardcoded constraints, origins
became `*`, secrets were placed in environment variables, or broad IAM was
introduced.
