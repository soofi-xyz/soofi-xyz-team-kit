# Portal Verification Gates

Always run the repository's required gates: lint, typecheck, relevant tests,
build, and any CI checks required by its conventions. Then select
scope-appropriate gates below from `changeRequest.scopes`.

All six gates apply to a full `new_repository` portal delivery. For an
`existing_repository` change, run a gate only when the changed surface or an
acceptance criterion requires it. Mark unrelated gates **not applicable** with
a one-line reason; do not call them blocked or passed. A required gate must pass
and retain evidence before handoff. Do not replace failures with waivers or
mock results.

A named acceptance criterion is still required implementation work when the
agent cannot execute it locally. Missing soak tokens, BrowserStack secrets, or
AWS keys do not make that criterion not applicable. Write the sibling-style
script, attach it to the existing deploy or preview workflow, and report that
CI will run it.

| Changed scope | Additional required gates |
| --- | --- |
| Backend behavior | API unit/contract tests; live integration and latency only when deployment/live verification is explicitly in scope |
| Frontend behavior or appearance | Responsive design tests |
| User flow, auth, or integration boundary | Scenario-derived feature and approved development integration runs; BrowserStack full flow when cross-browser proof is required |
| Infrastructure | Synthesis/diff plus the repository's infrastructure tests |
| Code-only refactor | Repository gates and focused regression tests; live deployment gates are not applicable |

## Gate 1: API unit tests

Apply when backend code, API contracts, or backend infrastructure changes.

- Require a 100% test pass rate.
- For a new portal, require at least 80% statement, branch, function, and line
  coverage for the backend.
- For an existing project, require no coverage regression, preserve its
  existing threshold, and require at least 80% coverage for new backend modules
  unless the repository has a stricter rule.
- Exercise successful responses, validation failures, authorization behavior,
  upstream failures, and timeout/error mapping.
- When a user-supplied Hoothoot query is wired, assert its exact
  reference/digest and parameter mapping plus the expected result contract.
  Do not test or alter query semantics as if Hoopa authored them.
- Save the machine-readable coverage artifact path and summary.

Any failed applicable test or violated coverage threshold blocks handoff.

## Gate 2: Responsive design tests

Apply only when frontend behavior or appearance changes.

Use the portal spec's exact route and state inventory. Capture and compare all
required screens at the declared mobile, tablet, and desktop widths. Test at
least one authenticated and one unauthenticated state when the portal has auth.

Use deterministic data, disable incidental animation, and retain diff images.
An approved baseline update must be reviewable in the feature branch; never
update baselines merely to hide a mismatch.

Run design assertions on the composed final route with its real parent
containers and theme. Isolated component proof is insufficient. For every
Figma-driven control or action, assert computed text, icon, fill, and border
colors separately; measure indicator and underline/divider geometry; and bind
button variants to stable action identities so DOM order or embedding cannot
reverse the visual hierarchy. Follow `07-figma-visual-fidelity.md`.

## Gate 3: BrowserStack full flow

Apply when the change affects a user flow, authentication, browser integration,
or a deployed preview and the acceptance criteria require cross-browser proof.

Run Playwright user-behavior flows in BrowserStack against the deployed
Amplify preview URL. Cover the primary persona journey, auth boundaries,
validation errors, backend-dependent success, and logout/session expiration
when applicable.

The preview must call the real feature backend URL captured from its deployment
output. Before the run, fail if frontend runtime configuration points to
production, localhost, a mock server, or another environment. A local-only
Playwright result does not satisfy this gate.

Record:

- BrowserStack project and build URL
- commit SHA and feature branch
- preview URL
- feature API URL
- browser/device matrix
- pass/fail counts

All required flows must pass.

If a real-device landing-page design spec fails on React minified
`#418` / `#423` / `#425` and this change did not touch that landing app,
ignore those iOS Safari hydration console codes. That is not a payments
or overlay regression and must not block the feature PR.

## Gate 4: Scenario integration lifecycle

Apply when the story supplies test scenarios or the change affects a user
journey, auth flow, provider/API seam, persistence boundary, navigation handoff,
iframe, or another integration boundary.

Load `skills/unified-portal-smoke-testing/`. Normalize every story scenario to a
stable ID and create an independently runnable integration test from its
preconditions, steps, expected result, approved fixture label, and safe stop.
Commit those tests on the feature branch before executing them. Use the target
repository's existing Playwright/browser framework and real non-production
services; do not mock or intercept the primary seam.

Run the exact feature deployment in two explicitly labeled lanes:

1. preserve a normal-security browser baseline so a real CORS failure is
   observable;
2. run every scenario through the skill's isolated CORS-disabled Chrome profile
   against the same feature URL.

A CORS-disabled pass proves functionality behind the CORS boundary but does not
prove correct CORS configuration and cannot turn a normal-security blocker into
a release pass.

Publish feature evidence, then stop for explicit approval before development
verification. Do not infer merge permission from permission to test. Once the
development deployment is proven to contain the feature commit and same test
suite, rerun every scenario against the exact development URL with normal
browser security. If tests changed during review, rerun the feature lane first.

For each scenario and environment, record result, test source/title, branch,
commit, test-suite digest, deployment/check identity, sanitized URL, browser
security mode, timing, expected and observed result, and links to
trace/video/CI artifacts. Capture a sanitized PNG from the actual browser run at
every declared evidence checkpoint, including at least the final asserted UI
state. Mask sensitive selectors, verify the image is readable and not a loading
or blank state, and index its SHA-256 digest in `evidence.json`.

Preserve each checkpoint PNG and generate an attachment-friendly contact sheet
for each environment and browser-security lane. Label contact-sheet cards with
scenario ID, result, environment, branch, short commit, security mode, and
capture time without altering the source screenshot. Never synthesize or
re-stage a missing success image.

Produce `evidence.json` plus a compact `evidence.md` index in the approved
artifact store. Attach or link the contact sheets and source images to the Asana
user story when authorized; otherwise return an attachment-ready package and
copy-pasteable Asana summary.

Any omitted, skipped, stale, wrong-environment, mock-backed, or unproven scenario
is `NOT RUN` or `BLOCKED`, never `PASS`.

## Gate 5: Backend integration

For `new_repository`, apply this gate. For `existing_repository`, apply only
when `deployment` is in `changeRequest.scopes` or an acceptance criterion
explicitly requires live feature/dev or real-upstream verification.

Seed or attach the user-supplied `datasetRef` in the approved development
environment. Run API contract and frontend integration tests against the
deployed backend. Do not use fixtures that bypass Lambda, API Gateway,
authorization, secrets retrieval, or required upstream calls.

Confirm authenticated GETs with a fetch that sends
`Authorization: Bearer` from the logged-in session (Cognito ID token when
present, otherwise the legacy session token). Opening the API URL in the
address bar sends no Authorization header and is not an auth test. A
gateway body of `{"message":"Unauthorized"}` or
`WWW-Authenticate: ... signing method HS256 is invalid` means the request
never reached Lambda; that usually means a JWT authorizer is still in
front of a shared `/api/v2` GET whose siblings use `NONE`, or the
feature Lambda was never dispatched (`workflow_dispatch` on the feature
branch). API Gateway `{"message":"Not Found"}` when the live test
expected 401 means the physical GET route is missing — often because
CloudFormation deleted an old `CfnRoute`. Missing Persist debt must be
**404**, not **502**. A CORS miss against a literal `*` origin is also
not an auth failure.

When the deployed feature uses a Hoothoot query, verify the deployed endpoint
against the supplied parameter and result contract and retain evidence tied to
the query reference/digest. Query semantics and efficiency remain Hoothoot's
responsibility.

Redact credentials and customer records from logs and evidence.

## Gate 6: API latency

For `new_repository`, apply this gate. For `existing_repository`, apply only
when `deployment` is in `changeRequest.scopes` and API performance is affected,
or an acceptance criterion explicitly requires latency evidence.

When the criterion applies, implement a sibling-style soak or
`reference/measure-latency.mjs` runner **and** add it to the existing deploy
or preview workflow. Do not leave a local script unwired. If the story
allows it, CI may skip the live run when secrets are unset; the skip must
log the missing names. If the story requires live DEV proof or a timed
soak with no skipped tests, fail the **live/soak steps** when they cannot
authenticate, and count only HTTP 200 responses for p95. Do not fail
**preflight/deploy** because a GitHub bearer secret the repo never had is
unset, and do not invent `DEV_*_BEARER_TOKEN` secrets. After deploy, mint
an HS256 token from the secret already on the Lambda (or the Secrets
Manager id the stack already injects) and default the soak account to a
named DEV fixture. The soak must actually run for the named duration
(five minutes when that is the criterion).

Measure deployed API responses with representative data from `datasetRef`.
This gate measures the complete API response, not page load, local handlers, or
mocks. Use `reference/measure-latency.mjs`:

```bash
API_URL="$FEATURE_API_URL" \
EXPECTED_API_URL="$RECORDED_FEATURE_API_URL" \
DATASET_PATH="$REPRESENTATIVE_DATASET_PATH" \
REQUEST_COUNT=100 \
LATENCY_OUTPUT_PATH="artifacts/latency.json" \
node skills/build-portals/reference/measure-latency.mjs
```

`EXPECTED_API_URL` must come independently from the recorded feature-stack
deployment output; the runner rejects a mismatched target. It accepts only
HTTPS URLs without embedded credentials, query strings, or fragments.

The dataset is a non-empty JSON array of request objects:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "/records/search",
    "method": "POST",
    "headerEnv": { "authorization": "TEST_AUTHORIZATION" },
    "body": { "query": "representative-input" }
  }
]
```

Store real test credentials outside the dataset file. `headerEnv` maps an HTTP
header to the environment variable containing its complete runtime value, such
as `Bearer <token>`. Never commit a populated authorization header. Run enough
requests to represent the accepted flow; increase `REQUEST_COUNT` when the
supplied dataset or performance plan requires it.

GET and HEAD are the safe default. A dataset containing POST, PUT, PATCH, or
DELETE requires `ALLOW_MUTATING_REQUESTS=true` plus an explicitly approved
synthetic/test tenant and idempotent or disposable test data. Never run the
latency tool against production.

Sort measured durations and calculate the nearest-rank percentile. The p95
requirement is strictly `< 200` ms; p95 equal to or greater than 200 ms fails.
Any non-successful API response also fails.

## Required evidence

Keep applicable artifacts in the repository or approved CI store and attach
their links to the pull request and delivery task:

- unit-test result and coverage path
- responsive design baselines and diff report
- BrowserStack build URL
- Amplify preview URL
- real feature API URL
- latency JSON (`artifacts/latency.json`)
- integration test result
- per-scenario feature and approved development `evidence.json` / `evidence.md`
  links, including normal-security and CORS-disabled labels
- per-scenario checkpoint PNGs with SHA-256 digests and one contact sheet per
  environment/browser-security lane
- Asana user-story evidence attachment or attachment-ready summary

Evidence must identify the feature commit tested. Missing, stale, production,
or mock-backed evidence blocks handoff only when that gate applies. The handoff
must separately list passed, blocked, and not-applicable gates.
