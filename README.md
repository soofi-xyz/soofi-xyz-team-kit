# soofi-xyz-cursor-plugin

A [Cursor plugin](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) packaging company-wide project subagents for AI-assisted development.

## Installation

Clone this repository into Cursor's local plugins directory so it is auto-discovered as `soofi-xyz`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
git clone https://github.com/soofi-xyz/cursor-plugin.git ~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz
```

Then reload Cursor. The plugin will load from `~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz` and register all agents and skills automatically.

## Updating

Pull the latest agents and skills from the same directory:

```bash
git -C ~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz pull
```

Reload Cursor after pulling so updated agents, skills, and the manifest are picked up.
